# DDA_FPS_game
This is my final year project. The game was created by my own by using UNITY with UFPS Library. It is a FPS game which collects player movements and behaviors and then it predicts the player strategy (Player style : Aggressive, Passive etc) Then according to that the  game changes itself to make the game interest to the player.
